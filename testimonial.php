                        Japan. Scheduled for delivery by end of day, Friday at 9 pm it says due to bad weather no
                        delivery. Company practices are good though . i will definitely using them again. insurances are pretty high but
                        refundable once package arrives but it is totally worth it .

                        shipping Service promised to deliver a very small package from the UK on a
                        date specific. About noon on that day I received an e-mail and SMS advising
                        me they were unable to deliver based on an incorrect address. The address was
                        correct and their driver also had my phone number which he/she didn't bother
                        to use. I advised them that the address was, in fact, correct both via their
                        website and their 800 number. I was told they would attempt to redeliver same
                        day but it was not guaranteed. Didn't happen at which point I was told they
                        would reattempt
                        delivery the next day but it wasn't guaranteed.

                        of shoes from USA and they required me to pay tax and duty fee on it, which was $88.
                        Since I am a student so I donâ€™t want to pay that crazy money, thereby I went to
                        CSBA to self-clear my package. I got the form saying it's already paid off.
                        I sent it to All Shipping Service at the same day and received an email confirmed
                        the fee had been cleared. The next day, they delivered it to me while asking me to pay
                        the fee. I was so greatly surprised and confused. I had to call their customer service,
                        brokerage in order to sort it out and reschedule it at
                        pickup location. Despite I had done everything I could and it was not my fault at all,
                        even the delivery guy did not help me or advise me to call All Shipping Service. All he did is
                        kept telling me he just cared about the system, not my things and walked away.

                        two weeks. Both shipments have been held in Melrose Park, Illinois for 2+ Weeks! The products that
                        I have received from other carriers such as UPS and FedEx have been delayed and have

                        All Shipping service  would not delivery my shipment, and when they asked me what I wanted to do,
                        I replied in writing to return the shipment to sender. Instead DHL destroyed
                        my entire shipment.
                        How does All Shipping Service  defend 1)   deliveries package On Time ; and
                        2) Keeping Shipment safe ?
                        It seems that is the new All Shipping Service policy: 1)  deliver parcels; 2)
                        follow the customer's  instructions; and 3) keping Safe customer shipment and
                        4) reimburse the customer for the value of the goods.

                        Worst "Logistics" company I have ever encountered. I ordered a specialty item from Japan via Amazon.
                        It arrived promptly in Austin. I was notified that they delivered
                        it on Friday 7/31 - only they didn't. It took until Monday for them
                        to find it - in their Austin airport office, with $41.79 import fees due.
                        The payment link did not work however since the item had "already been delivered.
                        " Eventually they gave me a phone number to their Tax & Duty office.
                        They could not make the link work either, so they took payment by phone and
                        my bank sent notice of successful charges to All Shipping Service. They were supposed to send me an email receipt
                        - they didn't. Then they could not schedule delivery since "it had already been delivered".
                        So I drove to their airport office and the guy at the counter took mercy on me,
                        copied my driverâ€™s license and had me sign some paperwork. I took the package home.
